## Report

I used Svelte framework to create javascript application.
There are was several reasons why I chose Svelte framework:
* first, I had some experience with it
* second, it has next pros:
> * Lightweight and easy to implement
> * Lesser boilerplate
> * Very easy to learn
> * It comes with a built-in reactive store
* next, it has cool features:
> * virtual DOM
> * This converts codes into Vanilla JavaScript
> * Very reactive

However, I should also report about its cons:
Cons
> * Not an extremely recognized framework
> * There is continuous requirement to explore and update
> * Not many such tools in the market
> * Smaller-sized community and ecosystem
