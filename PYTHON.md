## Best practices

1. Create a Code Repository and Implement Version Control
2. Create Readable Documentation
3. Follow Style Guidelines


## Flask Framework

Flask Framework is a python microframework. A good Flask
example is it is used by LinkedIn and Pinterest.

Pros:
* It includes a built-in development server, and unit-testing support.
* It is also fully Unicode-enabled with RESTful request-dispatching and 
WSGI compliance.
* Easy to manage due to its size. It does not need any tools or libraries.
Flask will be useful when you want to develop small, simple applications.
* With it, you can operate your database however you like- using SQLAlchemy or whatever.
* I have experience working with Flask.

Cons:
* Not rich functionality.
* It has no database abstraction layer or form validation. Can be added
as extensions.


## Linter

Basic linter - python-app linter

check dependencies and code style by flake8

I chose it because nothing needs to be configured in yml file, by that I mean
github already suplies with ready template
