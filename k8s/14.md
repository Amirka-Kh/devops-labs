kube-prometheus-stack contains next components:

- Prometheus Operator - an operator which provides prometheus monitoring with needed components for deploying and working
in k8s

- Prometheus - an application which collect logs and store metrics

- Alertmanager - some service which send notification via different methods about service alerts (Prometheus alerts) 

- Prometheus node-exporter - some exporter which monitor and send hardware and OS logs to Prometheus

- Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs - some adapter which monitor and send metrics to Prometheus

- kube-state-metrics - a service which monitor k8s objects' state

- Grafana - an application which provides log and metrics visualization


I took next step to install Kube Prometheus Stack:

- I followed instructions provided [here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) and use next commands to change minikube version:
`$ minikube delete && minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.23.0 --memory=6g --bootstrapper=kubeadm --extra-config=kubelet.authentication-token-webhook=true --extra-config=kubelet.authorization-mode=Webhook --extra-config=scheduler.bind-address=0.0.0.0 --extra-config=controller-manager.bind-address=0.0.0.0`
then following this [guideline](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
I entered next commands: 
```
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install monitor prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```
output:

Next I accessed Grafana with `minikube service monitoring-grafana`. However,
I received error and went to check available services:

The reason was in values, therefore I created a file for values
with next contains:
```
alertmanager:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer

grafana:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
  adminPassword: 'admin'
```
Next I used command: 
`helm upgrade -f monitor-values.yaml monitor prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack`
output:
